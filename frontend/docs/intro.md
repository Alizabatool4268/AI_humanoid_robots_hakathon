# Book Intro

lets discover **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**.

Humanoid robotics is entering a new era—one where perception, language, and action come together to create robots that can understand the world and interact naturally with humans. This book is designed as a complete, hands-on guide for learners and builders who want to explore the systems powering modern humanoid robots.

We start with the foundations of ROS 2, simulation workflows, and robotic modeling, then move into advanced ecosystems like NVIDIA Isaac and Nav2. From there, you’ll learn how multimodal AI—vision, language, and action—unlocks intelligent behavior, and how conversational robotics enables robots to respond to spoken commands. The journey ends with a full capstone: building an autonomous humanoid capable of executing tasks through natural speech.

Whether you’re a beginner or advancing your skills, this book equips you with the tools, concepts, and workflows required to build the robots of tomorrow.
