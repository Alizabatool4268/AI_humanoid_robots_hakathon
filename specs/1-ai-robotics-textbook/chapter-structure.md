### 2. Core Concepts
- Explain the fundamental concepts related to the topic
- Use 3-4 paragraphs to cover the essential ideas
- Include technical details relevant to humanoid robotics applications
- Use clear, simple language while maintaining technical accuracy
- Include diagrams or illustrations if helpful (to be added later)

### 3. Simple Example or Scenario
- Provide a concrete example that illustrates the concepts
- Use a relatable scenario that connects to humanoid robotics
- Show how the concepts apply in practice
- Keep the example simple and easy to understand

### 4. Relevance to Humanoid Robotics
- Explain specifically how these concepts apply to humanoid robots
- Describe real-world applications or potential implementations
- Connect the topic to the broader goals of physical AI and humanoid robotics
- Highlight unique considerations for humanoid robots versus other robotic systems

### 5. Short Summary
- Summarize the key points covered in the chapter
